# AI-Powered AR Product Visualization Platform

An Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality platform designed to transform how users explore products by visualizing them in real-world environments. This system enables interactive product viewing at realistic scale using computer vision, AI-generated 3D assets, and augmented reality.

## 🚀 Project Vision

Traditional online shopping relies on static images that often fail to represent real-world size, appearance, or spatial context. This project aims to bridge the gap between digital and physical experiences by allowing users to visualize products directly within their surroundings through augmented reality.

The platform is designed to be domain-agnostic and applicable across multiple industries, including:

- E-commerce and online shopping
- Fashion and wearable items
- Vehicles (cars, bikes, scooters)
- Furniture and home decor
- Instruments and electronics
- Retail product visualization
- Restaurant menus and food items

## 🧠 Core Concept

Instead of generating new visual assets for every user request, the system leverages AI to create optimized digital product representations once, which can then be dynamically scaled, positioned, and interacted with in augmented reality.

This ensures:

- Fast performance
- Consistent visual quality
- Scalable architecture

## 🏗️ System Architecture (High-Level)

Mobile/Web AR Client  
→ Detects surfaces and environment  
→ Retrieves product assets from backend  

Backend API  
→ Manages product metadata  
→ Serves pre-generated 3D assets  
→ Integrates AI pipelines  

AI Module  
→ Image preprocessing and segmentation  
→ Image-to-3D asset generation  
→ Optional variant generation
